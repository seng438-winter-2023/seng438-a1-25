# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to gain a comprehensive understanding of software testing. Within this, we applied a variety of testing techniques such as exploratory testing, manual scripted testing and regression testing. We were also familiarized with industrial defect tracking systems, processes and practices. 

Going into this lab, we had some prior knowledge pertaining to the practices of exploratory and manual functional testing. With exploratory testing, tests are created and executed simultaneously while following no particular structured approach. This gives the tester freedom to play around with the software on hand and create realistic scenarios an actual user might come across. With manual functional testing, the basic principle involves following a structured approach where the tester follows a laid out test suite and simply verifies if each test passes or fails.


# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our approach for testing the functionality of the system involves testing each aspect individually for a brief period of time. Since there are roughly five main functions (logging in and four transaction types), we will spend an even split of approximately six minutes per function and attempt to test as many different input combinations as possible. By splitting into each of these sections, we will be able to test a variety of categories such as ensuring GUI elements are updated and function logic is performed correctly. Each of these sections will also be tested in two phases. The first phase will involve working with a series of normal inputs to simulate an ordinary user using the system. This will be followed by the next phase where we will work with more unconventional inputs to simulate users who may make mistakes in inputs or attempt to break the system.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

### **Exploratory Testing** 
Exploratory testing is a human-based form of testing where tests are created and executed simutaneously. This form of testing relies on creative freedom of the tester and their own ability to create constructive tests. The tester will attempt to investigate the program, and explore the limits of the system’s functionalities. Through this process, the tester will be able to further grasp the program’s functionalities and be able to constitute new and more refined tests. The primary benefit of exploratory testing is the ability to uncover bugs that conventional scripted testing usually misses. Since exploratory tests are not constrained to the same conventions of scripted testing, the tester can often test a greater variation of scenarios and cases. This allows exploratory testing to excel at finding edge cases that lead to quality failure. This was evident when each pair performed the exploratory testing phase. We were able to find many edge cases, especially in regards to testing invalid inputs, that the manual functioning tests did not cover. Furthermore, exploratory testing can often be completed at a much faster pace than conventional scripted testing. Scripted testing often requires greater setup including carefully creating both the test cases and test themselves. Since we did not need to create these scripted tests ourselves, overall both approach required similar time, but we can infer that if these scripted tests were to be created ourselves, the time needed to complete these tests would be exponentially longer in comparison to an exploratory approach. As new software engineers with very little testing experience, we noticed there were many tests missing within our exploratory approach in comparison to the scripted tests. Furthermore, since exploratory testing is often based on the tester’s spontaneous decisions and actions, recreations of the test itself is often difficult. Thus, during our exploratory approach when discovering a bug, we were not able to accurately rediscover the exact inputs and decisions to replicate the bug.

### **Manual Functional Testing**
Manual functional testing is a series of predetermined test cases meant to test various use-cases of the application. These are tests that were pre-planned by the development team for how they think a user may use the product. Utilizing this process, the developers can ensure that the application is working for its main functionalities, as well as the reasons for which it was designed. Scripted tests account for the majority of the cases that the application will be used for, but may not account for all possible use cases of the program, especially some edge cases. Scripted testing also does not require much knowledge of the product to execute, as all that the tester needs to do is follow the test instructions and compare the actual and expected outputs. This is in contrast to exploratory testing, where the tester needs to have a vast knowledge of the product and some creativity to test the edge cases of the product. Some of the disadvantages of scripted testing is that it may not account for all the use cases of the program. Additionally, it requires a lot more setup and thought to design the tests and the test cases, rather than just randomly using the program and looking for bugs. It also is limited because it is subjective to the developer’s view of how the program should be used, and does not really account for user creativity of using the program for something else.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 
The lab work was divided evenly amongst all group members. The two teams, Abhiraam and Siwon and, Sahil and Harshal worked independently in their groups during the exploratory testing period. Both teams followed a similar approach during this phase. One member was responsible for testing the application and attempting to discover bugs while the other member was responsible to keep track of the steps taken and write a detailed description for the discovered bug. During manual functional testing, all group members got together to work on the section. We had two members run the program, working on the same test at the same time. This was to ensure that when a bug was discovered, it wasn't due to the individual's mistakes during testing. The other group members would play a management role in the tests, such as keeping track of which tests have been performed, reporting any defects found and determining what order to execute tests in. As for regression testing, we followed a similar approach to our manual functional testing.
