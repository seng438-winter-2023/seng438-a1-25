# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to gain a comprehensive understanding of software testing. Within this, we applied a variety of testing techniques such as exploratory testing, manual scripted testing and regression testing. We were also familiarized with industrial defect tracking systems, processes and practices. 

Going into this lab, we had some prior knowledge pertaining to the practices of exploratory and manual functional testing. With exploratory testing, tests are created and executed simultaneously while following no particular structured approach. This gives the tester freedom to play around with the software on hand and create realistic scenarios an actual user might come across. With manual functional testing, the basic principle involves following a structured approach where the tester follows a laid out test suite and simply verifies if each test passes or fails.
